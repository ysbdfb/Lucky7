Step 1

· Create a game that randomizes 3 numbers that are between 1-10. Then print the three random numbers to the console.

· Check if one of the numbers is 7. If is, print “You won” to the console. If any of those three numbers are not 7, print “You lost” to the console.

Step 2 Continue with the game as follows:

· Add money to the game. The player has 5€. Every game costs 1€. If one of the numbers are 7, the player wins 3€. If all the numbers are 7, the player wins 10€ and if there are two sevens, the player wins 5€. It is okay to have only one winning formula. If the player has lost all his/hers money, the game ends.

· You need a loop structure here...

· If you get stuck with the if statements, there is a flow chart available in the end of this assignment.

Step 3 Continue with the game as follows:

· At the beginning of the game, ask from the player, how much the player wants to spend money.

· After each round, ask from the player, if he/she wants to play again.
